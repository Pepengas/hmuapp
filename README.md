# HMU App

This project contains a simple Android application written in Kotlin. The default language is Greek with English translations available. It demonstrates the use of Jetpack Navigation with fragments and a bottom navigation bar for the following screens:

- News
- Announcements
- Events
- Teachers
- Student Links

The Map screen exists in the navigation graph but is not shown in the bottom
navigation menu due to the five item limit of `BottomNavigationView`.

Each screen currently shows a placeholder layout.
